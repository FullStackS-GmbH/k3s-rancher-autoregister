## Use Case

This is a mockup of a self registering K3S cluster in Rancher.
The self-registering is done via the Rancher API and Shell scripts inside a (auto deployed) Pod, running in the local cluster.

This mockup is used for SUSECON DIGITAL 2021 together
with our partner OpenNebula Systems showcasing a new approach for the far edge.

***Warning***

This is not fail-safe and production ready.
It is an mockup for showcasing possibilites.
In production we run those automations with a different approach.
